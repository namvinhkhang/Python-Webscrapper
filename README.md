# Python-Webscrapper
1st try

29/05:
Successfully scraped off "https://offcampushousing.umass.edu/housing/" (UMASS site) and stored values: link, name, address, etc to a dictionary for every configuration of the listings and stored each in a list.


NEXT STEP:
 - Learn Panda or MatplotLib to plot the data in various way
 - Then potentially build a simple website using react.js for frontend (A way to learn React.js)


31/05:
Implemented a simple ML Model using RandomForestRegressor, handled missing data (imputing), reconfigured the data frame for easier data process
Still haven't figured out how to graph these data in an easy-to-understand or useful way and what the website is gonna look like.


NEXT STEP:
 - Figure out the necessary plots to do and implement it
 - The website can be pushed back later

03/06:
Finished plotting. NOW, transform it into an actual working web app.

NEXT STEP:
 - Follow the guide below (from ChatGPT so could be outdated or incorrect):
   1. **Environment Setup**: Install tools and set up version control.
   2. **Backend Development**: Create Flask/Django routes for scraping, visualization, and ML predictions.
   3. **Frontend Development**: Create React/Vue/Angular components for user interaction.
   4. **Database Integration**: Set up and connect to a database.
   5. **Machine Learning Integration**: Serve the ML model via the backend.
   6. **Deployment**: Deploy your application using a platform like Heroku.
   7. **Testing**: Ensure your application works correctly through testing.
