# Python-Webscrapper
1st try

29/05:
Successfully scraped off "https://offcampushousing.umass.edu/housing/" (UMASS site) and stored values: link, name, address, etc to a dictionary for every configuration of the listings and stored each in a list.


NEXT STEP:
 - Learn Panda or MatplotLib to plot the data in various way
 - Then potentially build a simple website using react.js for frontend (A way to learn React.js)


31/05:
Implemented a simple ML Model using RandomForestRegressor, handled missing data (imputing), reconfigured the data frame for easier data process
Still haven't figured out how to graph these data in an easy-to-understand or useful way and what the website is gonna look like.


NEXT STEP:
 - Figure out the necessary plots to do and implement it
 - The website can be pushed back later
